# Best-Line-Fit-Calculator
This project will give u the best line fit for the points. This application is required in almost all the courses and specifically in experiments where we are rquired to find the slope or the intercept from the graph.
I have used the numpy library to get the slope and the y-intercept of the best fit line and then plotted the graph using the matplotlib library.
HOPE IT HELPS U!!!!
